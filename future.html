                <p>The ever changing landscape of eCommerce is exciting. Every year, there are changes that may help us grow our businesses or new challenges that we may not be able to keep up. Whatever ups and downs you may have encountered this year, the eCommerce market is still expanding bigger and brighter as ever. As we approach a new year, we’re here to give you an exclusive sneak peek of the eCommerce growth trends in 2020 and beyond.
                     We have curated the following list of the hottest 10 international growth trends to spark new ideas, overcome the hurdles, and get you ready to win and maintain a successful eCommerce business for the years to come.</p>
                     <p> New studies projected that the worldwide retail eCommerce sales will reach a new high by 2021. Ecommerce businesses should anticipate a 265% growth rate, from $1.3 trillion in 2014 to $4.9 trillion in 2021. This shows a future of steady upward trend with no signs of decline. But, what’s even more interesting is the global eCommerce sales have been steadily eating up the worldwide retail market. 
                         In fact, by 2021, it will account for 17.5% of the total global retail sales.</p>
                         <p> If you think about it, that portion is still a small chunk of the global retail sales. This means more opportunity for growth in the future. To capitalize on this eCommerce trend, physical stores must embrace infrastructures to bring their businesses from offline to online while online businesses must find new ways to further elevate their brands online.
