                <p>Over the last few years, e-commerce has become an indispensable part of the global retail framework. Like many other industries, the retail landscape has undergone a substantial transformation following the advent of the internet, and thanks to the ongoing digitalization of modern life, consumers from virtually every country now profit from the perks of online transactions. 
                    As internet access and adoption are rapidly increasing around the globe, the number of digital buyers worldwide keeps climbing every year. In 2019, an estimated 1.92 billion people purchased goods or services online. During the same year, e-retail sales surpassed 3.5 trillion U.S. dollars worldwide, and according to the latest calculations, e-commerce growth will accelerate even further in the future.

                    The US was estimated to have 162.8 million mobile shoppers in 2019. As a result, store owners must ensure that their websites and ads are mobile-optimized to reach their target audience. According to Business Insider, men are also considered more likely to buy a product via a mobile device than women.
                    Women tend to shop online more frequently than men. For every $10 spent online, women are spending $6 while men spend $4.
                    Millennials, ages 18-34, tend to spend approximately $2000 online each year making it the generation that does the most online shopping.
