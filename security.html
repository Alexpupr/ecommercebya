                <p>  eCommerce security is the guidelines that ensure safe transaction through the internet. It consists of protocols that safeguard people who engage in online selling and buying of goods and services. You need to gain your customers trust by putting in place eCommerce security basics. Such basics include: Privacy, Integrity, Authentication and Non-repudiation. </p>
                <p> Privacy includes preventing any activity that will lead to the sharing of customers’ data with unauthorized third parties. Apart from the online seller that a customer has chosen, no one else should access their personal information and account details. A breach of confidentiality occurs when sellers let others have access to such information. An online business should put in place at least a necessary minimum of anti-virus, firewall, encryption, and other data protection. It will go a long way in protecting credit card and bank details of clients.</p>
                <p> Integrity is another crucial concept of eCommerce Security. It means ensuring that any information that customers have shared online remains unaltered. The principle states that the online business is utilizing the customers’ information as given, without changing anything. Altering any part of the data causes the buyer to lose confidence in the security and integrity of the online enterprise.</p>
                <p> The principle of authentication in eCommerce security requires that both the seller and the buyer should be real. They should be who they say they are. The business should prove that it is real, deals with genuine items or services, and delivers what it promises. The clients should also give their proof of identity to make the seller feel secure about the online transactions. It is possible to ensure authentication and identification. If you are unable to do so, hiring an expert will help a lot. Among the standard solutions include client logins information and credit card PINs.</p>
                <p> Repudiation means denial. Therefore, Non-repudiation is a legal principle that instructs players not to deny their actions in a transaction. The business and the buyer should follow through on the transaction part that they initiated. eCommerce can feel less safe since it occurs in cyberspace with no live video. Non-repudiation gives eCommerce security another layer. It confirms that the communication that occurred between the two players indeed reached the recipients. Therefore, a party in that particular transaction cannot deny a signature, email, or a purchase. </p>
