                <p> Electronic commerce or e-commerce is a business model that lets firms and individuals buy and sell things over the internet. 
                    E-commerce operates in all four of the following major market segments:	Business to business, Business to consumer, Consumer to consumer and Consumer to business. 
                    E-commerce, which can be conducted over computers, tablets, or smartphones may be thought of like a digital version of mail-order catalog shopping.
                     Nearly every imaginable product and service is available through e-commerce transactions, including books, music, plane tickets, and financial services such as stock investing and online banking. 
                     As such, it is considered a very disruptive technology. 
                    </p>
                    <p> E-commerce has helped businesses establish a wider market presence by providing cheaper and more efficient distribution channels for their products or services. For example, the mass retailer Target has supplemented its brick-and-mortar presence with an online store that lets customers purchase everything from clothes to coffeemakers to toothpaste to action figures.
                        By contrast, Amazon launched its business with an e-commerce-based model of online sales and product delivery. Not to be outdone, individual sellers have increasingly engaged in e-commerce transactions via their own personal websites. Finally, digital marketplaces such as eBay or Etsy serve as exchanges where multitudes of buyers and sellers come together to conduct business.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The marketing in eCommerce is a process that helps to drive sales for online stores, using platforms that are mostly online. This can include brand awareness campaigns, display advertising, discount QR codes, etc. Most marketing tactics come from traditional marketing strategies but applied online.

The beauty of marketing for ecommerce is that you can learn almost anything online through webinars, blogs, and ebooks. This means that everyone has the ability become successful through this type of marketing no matter your budget.

For example, the magazine classified section now encompasses Search Engines like Google and Bing. Google Ads, and social platforms control advertising. Furthermore, email has taken over from flyers and paper brochures. Other ecommerce marketing examples include affiliate marketing, social media marketing, video marketing, and influencer marketing.
