                <p> Online shopping was invented in pioneered in 1979 by entrepreneur Michael Aldrich in the United Kingdom. Aldrich was able to connect a modified domestic television to a real-time multi-user transaction processing computer via a telephone line. 
                    The system was marketed in 1980 and offered as business-to-business systems that were then sold in the UK, Ireland, and Spain. </p> 
                    <p> Book Stacks Unlimited, an online bookstore created by Charles M. Stack in 1992, was one of the earliest consumer shopping experiences. Stack’s store began as a dial-up bulletin board three years before Amazon was founded. 
                        In 1994, Book Stacks Unlimited moved to the Internet as Books.com and was eventually acquired by Barnes & Noble.  </p>  
                        <p> The August 12, 1994 issue of New York Times, appropriately titled “Internet is Open” chronicled the sale between two friends of a Sting CD. 
                            The Times said, “The team of young cyberspace entrepreneurs celebrated what was apparently the first retail transaction on the Internet using a readily available version of powerful data encryption software designed to guarantee privacy.”  </p> 
                            <p> Ecommerce started over 40 years ago, when the introduction of early technology like Electronic Data Interchange and teleshopping in the 1970s paved the way for the modern-day ecommerce store as we know it today. </p>
                            <p> The history of ecommerce is closely intertwined with the history of the internet. Online shopping became possible when the internet was opened to the public in 1991. Amazon was one of the first ecommerce sites in the US to start selling products online and thousands of businesses have followed since. 
                                The convenience, safety, and enjoyable user experience of ecommerce have improved exponentially since the inception of online shopping. In his article, we will discuss some of the key players and milestones of ecommerce. </p>
